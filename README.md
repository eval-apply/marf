## Status

### v1.0 and v2.0 Branches

These branches are the verbatim, original code drop from roman_f.

Neither of these branches is verified at the moment, or known to work.
The hex firmware images checked in are not identical to the published firmware images
on the [Electronic Music Store build page](https://electricmusicstore.com/blogs/build/115318789-multiple-arbitrary-function-generator-model-248).

Until these are verified, I do not recommend attempting to use these images.

### v2.5

This project was converted to Atlloic TrueSTUDIO for STM32 v9.3.0 under the
Windows 7 operating system. Additionally I used STM32Programmer, and STMStudio.
Both are available on the st.com website.

The ST-LInk JTAG programmer was used for debugging and  firmware downloading.
I installed all the applicable libraries for the STM32f405RG from st.com.

Here's the link to the [STM32f405 resource page](https://my.st.com/content/my_st_com/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus/stm32-high-performance-mcus/stm32f4-series/stm32f405-415.html#overview) on st.com:

Be sure to install the `STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.24.0` driver

You'll need to download and install
Atollic TrueSTUDIO at https://atollic.com/resources/download/windows/

The TrueStudio project in this folder should work properly assuming you've installed
the driver for the board and ST-Link. The file structure was generated by
TrueStudio. You may have to tweak your paths in the IDE to make it work.
