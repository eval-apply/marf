## Status

Neither of these branches is verified at the moment, or known to work. 
The hex firmware images checked in are not identical to the published firmware images
on the [Electronic Music Store build page](https://electricmusicstore.com/blogs/build/115318789-multiple-arbitrary-function-generator-model-248).

Until these are verified, I do not recommend attempting to use these images.
