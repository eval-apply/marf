Source code for electronic music store MARF 248r v2.5


MARF Projrct v2.5
 This project was developed on Atloic TrueSTUDIO for STM32 v9.3.0 under the Windows 7 operating system. 
 Additionally I used STM32Programmer, and STMStudio. Both are available on the st.com website. 
 
 The ST-LInk JTAG programmer was used for debugging and  firmware downloading. 
 I installed all the applicable libraries for the STM32f405RG from st.com. 

Here's the link to the STM32f405 resource page on st.com:

Be sure to install the STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.24.0 driver

You'll need to download and install 
Atollic TrueSTUDIO at https://atollic.com/resources/download/windows/


The TrueStudio projrct in this folder should work properly assuming you've installed the driver for the board and ST-Link. The file structure was generated by TrueStudio.
